<h2 align="center">Krypton</h2>

<b>General Information:-</b>
<ul>
  <li>Symbol: Kr</li>
  <li>Atomic Number: 36</li>
  <li>Atomic Mass: 83.798 amu</li>
  <li>Group: 18 (Noble Gases)</li>
  <li>Period: 4</li>
  <li>Block: p-block</li>
  <li>Electron Configuration: (1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>6</sup>3d<sup>10</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>4p<sup>6</sup>)</li>
  <li>Valence Electrons: 8</li>
</ul>

<b>Physical Properties:-</b>
<ul>
  <li>Appearance: Colorless gas, glows with a whitish-green or pale blue light when excited.</li>
  <li>Density: 3.749 g/L (at 0°C and 1 atm).</li>
  <li>Melting Point: -157.37°C (-251.27°F).</li>
  <li>Boiling Point: -153.415°C (-244.147°F).</li>
  <li>State at Room Temperature: Gas.</li>
  <li>Conductivity: Non-conductor of electricity in normal conditions but becomes conductive in a plasma state.</li>
</ul>

<b>Chemical Properties:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Reactivity:
    <ul>
      <li>Extremely low reactivity due to a full valence electron shell.</li>
      <li>Forms compounds only under extreme conditions (e.g., krypton difluoride, KrF<sub>2</sub>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inert Behavior: Resists chemical reactions under standard conditions.</li>
  <li>Flame Color: Emits a whitish-green light when electrified.</li>
</ol>

<b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Abundance in Earth's Atmosphere: ~1 ppm (0.0001% by volume).</li>
  <li>Sources:
    <ul>
      <li>Obtained as a byproduct during the fractional distillation of liquid air.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Uses of Krypton:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Lighting: Used in fluorescent lamps, neon lights, and high-intensity discharge lamps.</li>
  <li>Lasers: Krypton-ion lasers are used in scientific research and medical applications.</li>
  <li>Photography: Krypton-filled flash tubes are used for high-speed photography.</li>
  <li>Windows: Mixed with argon in insulated glazing to improve thermal efficiency.</li>
  <li>Standards: Previously used to define the meter's length based on its spectral lines (now replaced by more precise methods).</li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>No Known Biological Role: Krypton is biologically inert and non-toxic in low concentrations.</li>
  <li>Safety: High concentrations can displace oxygen in confined spaces, posing an asphyxiation risk.</li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Inert Nature: One of the noble gases, krypton rarely forms compounds under normal conditions.</li>
  <li>Emission Spectrum: Emits characteristic spectral lines, making it useful in scientific applications.</li>
  <li>Density: Heavier than air, which contributes to its limited use in specialized environments.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Krypton:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    Discovered in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers while analyzing the residue left after evaporating liquid air.
  </li>
  <li>Name Origin: Derived from the Greek word "kryptos," meaning "hidden."</li>
  <li>Applications Over Time: Initially a scientific curiosity, krypton gained importance in lighting and other technological applications.</li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Symbol Origin: "Kr" is derived from its Greek name.</li>
  <li>Rare Nature: Despite its rarity, krypton is commercially extracted from the atmosphere in small quantities.</li>
  <li>Glow: When electrified, krypton emits a distinctive whitish-green light, making it ideal for certain lighting applications.</li>
