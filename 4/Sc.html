  <li>Common Sources:
    <ul>
      <li>Found in minerals like thortveitite (Sc<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), euxenite, and gadolinite.</li>
      <li>Present in trace amounts in rare-earth ores.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Uses of Scandium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Aerospace Industry:
    <ul>
      <li>Used in lightweight, high-strength aluminum-scandium alloys for aircraft and spacecraft.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sports Equipment:
    <ul>
      <li>Used in high-performance sports gear like baseball bats, bicycle frames, and golf clubs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lighting:
    <ul>
      <li>Used in high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps for stadiums and film production.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nuclear Applications:
    <ul>
      <li>Scandium is used in nuclear reactors due to its low neutron absorption cross-section.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>No Known Biological Role:
    <ul>
      <li>Scandium is not essential for life and has no known biological role in humans or animals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Rare and Expensive: Scandium is one of the rarest transition metals and is difficult to extract from its ores.</li>
  <li>Alloying Agent: Small amounts of scandium can significantly improve the strength and corrosion resistance of aluminum alloys.</li>
  <li>Unique Lighting: Scandium iodide is used to enhance the color quality of light in lamps.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Scandium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    <ul>
      <li>Discovered in 1879 by Lars Fredrik Nilson, a Swedish chemist, while analyzing the mineral euxenite.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Naming:
    <ul>
      <li>Named "Scandium" after Scandinavia, where it was first identified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev: Mendeleev predicted the existence of scandium in 1869, calling it "ekaboron" based on its position in the periodic table.</li>
  <li>High Cost: Scandium is very expensive due to its scarcity and the difficulty of extraction, with prices often exceeding $1,500 per kilogram.</li>
  <li>High-Strength Alloys: Even a small addition of scandium to aluminum can greatly enhance its properties, making it valuable in advanced industries.</li>
</ol>
