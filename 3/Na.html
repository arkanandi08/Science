<li>Valence Electrons: 1  </li>
 </ul>


<b>Physical Properties:-</b><ul>
<li>Appearance: Soft, silvery-white, and metallic.  </li>
<li>Density: 0.968 g/cm³ (less dense than water). </li> 
<li>Melting Point: 97.79°C (208°F).</li>  
<li>Boiling Point: 882.8°C (1621°F).  </li>
<li>State at Room Temperature: Solid.  </li>
<li>Conductivity: Excellent conductor of heat and electricity.</li>
</ul>


<b>Chemical Properties:-</b>
<ol>
<li>Reactivity: <ul>
<li>Highly reactive, especially with water and air.</li>
    <li>Reacts violently with water to produce sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen gas:</li>
    <li>Reacts with oxygen to form sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>O).</li>
</ul>
    </li>
<li>Flame Color:
   Burns with a bright yellow flame.</li>
<li>Corrosive Behavior:
    Quickly oxidizes in air, forming a white coating of sodium oxide and sodium carbonate.</li>
</ol>

<b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Abundance in Earth's Crust: ~2.6% (6th most abundant element).</li>  
   <li>Commonly found as compounds, such as: <ul>
<li>Sodium chloride (NaCl): Found in seawater and rock salt.  </li>
     <li>Sodium carbonate : Found in mineral trona.  </li>
     <li>Sodium nitrate (NaNO<sub>3</sub>): Found in deposits in arid regions.</li>
   </ul>
     </li>
</ol>    

<b>Uses of Sodium:-</b> <ol>
<li>Industrial Chemicals:
    Sodium compounds like sodium hydroxide(caustic soda) and sodium carbonate (soda ash) are widely used in industries, including paper, soap, and textiles.</li> 
<li>Table Salt:
    Sodium chloride is essential for human consumption and food preservation.</li> 
<li>Metallurgy:
    Used to purify molten metals, including titanium.</li>
<li>Coolants:
    Liquid sodium is used as a coolant in nuclear reactors due to its high thermal conductivity.</li> 
<li>Lighting:
    Sodium vapor lamps are widely used for street lighting.</li> 
<li>Energy Storage:
    Sodium-based batteries are being developed as alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.</li> 
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b> <ol><li>Essential Element:
    Sodium is vital for life. It helps maintain fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction in the body.  </li> 
 <li>Regulation:
     Sodium levels are regulated by the kidneys and play a major role in blood pressure and hydration.
 </li>
</ol>
 
<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b> <ol>
  <li>Highly Reactive: Sodium cannot be found in its free form in nature because of its reactivity. </li> 
    <li>Low Density: It is one of the few metals that float on water.  </li>
  <li>Flame Test: Produces a bright yellow flame, a key feature in identifying sodium.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Sodium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    In 1807, Sir Humphry Davy, a British chemist, isolated sodium for the first time through the process of electrolysis of molten sodium hydroxide (NaOH).</li>
<li>Ancient Uses: <ul>
<li>Sodium compounds, like natron (a mix of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate), were used in ancient Egypt for embalming and cleaning.  </li>
    <li>Sodium chloride (table salt) has been a vital resource in human civilization, often used as currency and in trade.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
<li>19th–20th Century: <ul>
<li>Sodium metal was initially a scientific curiosity but became important in industries, especially in producing chemicals and refining metals.  </li>
    <li>The development of sodium-based coolants for nuclear reactors highlighted its industrial significance.</li>
</ul>
    </li> 
<li>Modern Applications:
    Today, sodium and its compounds are ubiquitous in industry, daily life (table salt), and cutting-edge technologies like energy storage systems.</li> 
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b> <ol>
<li>Symbol Origin: "Na" comes from the Latin word *natrium* (from natron, a sodium compound).  </li>
     <li>Discovery: Discovered in 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of molten sodium hydroxide.  </li>
      <li>Widespread Use: Sodium chloride (table salt) has been used for centuries as a preservative and flavor enhancer.</li>
