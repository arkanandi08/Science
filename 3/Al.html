  </li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Lightweight and Strong: Ideal for applications where weight is a critical factor.</li>
  <li>Corrosion Resistance: Forms a thin oxide layer that protects it from rusting.</li>
  <li>Highly Recyclable: Aluminium can be recycled without losing its properties.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Aluminium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    <ul>
      <li>First isolated in 1825 by Hans Christian Ørsted using electrolysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Industrial Use:
    <ul>
      <li>Widespread production began in the late 19th century with the Hall-Héroult process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Third Most Abundant Element: After oxygen and silicon, aluminium is the third most abundant element in Earth's crust.</li>
  <li>Light but Strong: Aluminium is one-third the density of steel but still strong enough for structural applications.</li>
  <li>Space Exploration: Used in spacecraft and satellites due to its strength, lightweight, and resistance to corrosion.</li>
