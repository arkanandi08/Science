  <li>Discovery:
    <ul>
      <li>Discovered in 1801 by English chemist Charles Hatchett in the mineral columbite.</li>
      <li>Initially named "columbium" (Cb), but renamed "niobium" in 1949 to standardize its name.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>19th–20th Century:
    <ul>
      <li>Primarily used in steelmaking and scientific research.</li>
