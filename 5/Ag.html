</ul>

<b>Chemical Properties:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Reactivity:
    <ul>
      <li>Low reactivity compared to other transition metals.</li>
      <li>Resistant to corrosion and oxidation but tarnishes when exposed to sulfur compounds, forming silver sulfide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Oxidation States: Commonly +1, rarely +2 and +3.</li>
</ol>

<b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Abundance in Earth's Crust: ~0.075 ppm (rare).</li>
  <li>Found in nature in both native form (pure silver) and in ores such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Argentite (Ag<sub>2</sub>S)</li>
      <li>Galena (PbS with silver impurities)</li>
      <li>Cerargyrite (AgCl)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Uses of Silver:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Jewelry and Silverware: Widely used for ornaments, cutlery, and decorative items.</li>
  <li>Electronics: Essential for electrical contacts, conductors, and circuit boards due to its high conductivity.</li>
  <li>Photography: Previously used in photographic films (silver halides).</li>
  <li>Medicine: Used in antimicrobial applications, wound dressings, and dental alloys.</li>
  <li>Coins: Historically used in coinage and still in some bullion coins.</li>
  <li>Solar Panels: Plays a key role in photovoltaic cells for solar energy production.</li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>No Known Biological Role: Silver is not essential for life.</li>
  <li>Antimicrobial Properties: Silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) are effective in killing bacteria and fungi.</li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Highest Conductivity: Silver has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of all elements.</li>
  <li>Reflectivity: Has the highest reflectivity of any metal, making it ideal for mirrors and coatings.</li>
  <li>Antimicrobial: Widely used for its ability to kill bacteria without being harmful to human tissues.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Silver:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    <ul>
      <li>Known since ancient times, with evidence of use dating back to 3000 BCE in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey).</li>
      <li>The name "silver" comes from the Anglo-Saxon word *seolfor*; the symbol "Ag" is derived from the Latin word *argentum*.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Historical Significance:
    <ul>
      <li>Highly valued in ancient civilizations for its rarity, beauty, and utility in trade and currency.</li>
