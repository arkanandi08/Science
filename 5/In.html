<b>Uses of Indium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Indium Tin Oxide (ITO): Widely used in touchscreens, LCDs, and solar panels.</li>
  <li>Semiconductors: Used in alloys for transistors and diodes.</li>
  <li>Solders: Low-melting-point indium alloys are used in specialty soldering applications.</li>
  <li>Coatings: Applied as a thin layer to prevent corrosion on metal surfaces.</li>
  <li>Cryogenics: Indium's ductility at low temperatures makes it useful for cryogenic applications.</li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>No Known Biological Role: Indium is not essential for life.</li>
  <li>Toxicity: Indium compounds are considered low in toxicity but can cause lung irritation if inhaled.</li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Soft Metal: Indium is so soft it can be cut with a knife.</li>
  <li>Ductility: Remains highly ductile even at very low temperatures.</li>
  <li>Audible Sound: When bent, indium emits a high-pitched "cry," similar to tin or gallium.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Indium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    <ul>
      <li>Discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter in Germany.</li>
      <li>Named after the indigo-blue spectral line observed during its analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Industrial Use:
    <ul>
      <li>Became important in the 20th century with the development of electronic devices and displays.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Symbol Origin: "In" is derived from its name, Indium, based on the indigo-blue spectral line.</li>
  <li>Low Melting Point: Has one of the lowest melting points among metals, making it useful for special alloys.</li>
  <li>Flexible Applications: Used in advanced technology like photovoltaics and touchscreens.</li>
</ol>
