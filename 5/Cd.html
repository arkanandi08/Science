</ul>

<b>Physical Properties:-</b>
<ul>
  <li>Appearance: Soft, silvery-white, and metallic.</li>
  <li>Density: 8.65 g/cm³</li>
  <li>Melting Point: 321.07°C (609.93°F)</li>
  <li>Boiling Point: 767°C (1413°F)</li>
  <li>State at Room Temperature: Solid</li>
  <li>Conductivity: Good conductor of electricity but not as high as silver or copper.</li>
</ul>

<b>Chemical Properties:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Reactivity:
    <ul>
      <li>Moderately reactive, forming compounds with oxygen, sulfur, and halogens.</li>
      <li>Stable in air but reacts with acids to produce hydrogen gas.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Oxidation States: Commonly +2.</li>
</ol>

<b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Abundance in Earth's Crust: ~0.1 ppm (relatively rare).</li>
  <li>Found in nature primarily as a byproduct of zinc refining, commonly in minerals such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Greenockite (CdS)</li>
      <li>Sphalerite (ZnS, with cadmium impurities)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Uses of Cadmium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Rechargeable Batteries: Widely used in nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries.</li>
  <li>Electroplating: Used to coat metals to prevent corrosion.</li>
  <li>Pigments: Cadmium compounds (e.g., cadmium sulfide) are used in vibrant yellow, orange, and red pigments.</li>
  <li>Alloys: Used in low-melting-point alloys and solders.</li>
  <li>Nuclear Reactors: Cadmium rods are used as neutron absorbers in nuclear reactors.</li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>No Known Biological Role: Cadmium is not essential for life.</li>
  <li>Toxicity: Cadmium and its compounds are highly toxic and can cause severe damage to the lungs, kidneys, and bones if inhaled or ingested.</li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Toxicity: Known for its significant environmental and health impacts when improperly handled.</li>
  <li>Soft Metal: Can be easily cut with a knife.</li>
  <li>Rare Use in Batteries: Although used in NiCd batteries, alternatives like lithium-ion batteries are reducing its demand.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Cadmium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    <ul>
      <li>Discovered in 1817 by Friedrich Stromeyer, a German chemist.</li>
      <li>Named after "cadmia," the Latin name for zinc carbonate, as it was found as an impurity in zinc ores.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Industrial Use:
    <ul>
      <li>Became widely used in the 20th century for electroplating, pigments, and batteries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Symbol Origin: "Cd" is derived from "cadmia," a historical name for zinc ores.</li>
  <li>Environmental Concern: Cadmium pollution is a major issue due to its toxicity and persistence in the environment.</li>
  <li>Softness: Cadmium is so soft that it can be scratched with a fingernail.</li>
