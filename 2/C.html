</ul>

<b>Physical Properties:-</b>
<ul>
  <li>Appearance: Exists in various forms (allotropes) such as diamond (transparent and crystalline) and graphite (black and opaque).</li>
  <li>Density:
    <ul>
      <li>Diamond: ~3.51 g/cm³</li>
      <li>Graphite: ~2.26 g/cm³</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Melting Point: Sublimates at ~3550°C (6422°F) under standard pressure (graphite).</li>
  <li>Boiling Point: ~4830°C (8726°F).</li>
  <li>State at Room Temperature: Solid.</li>
  <li>Conductivity:
    <ul>
      <li>Diamond: Poor conductor of electricity but excellent thermal conductor.</li>
      <li>Graphite: Good conductor of electricity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Chemical Properties:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Reactivity:
    <ul>
      <li>Forms strong covalent bonds with many elements, especially hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.</li>
      <li>Combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or carbon monoxide (CO).</li>
      <li>Reacts with metals to form carbides (e.g., calcium carbide).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Allotropes:
    <ul>
      <li>Diamond: Hardest natural substance.</li>
      <li>Graphite: Soft, slippery, and a good lubricant.</li>
      <li>Fullerenes: Molecules made of carbon atoms in spherical or cylindrical shapes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Abundance in Earth's Crust: ~0.02%.</li>
  <li>Commonly found in:
    <ul>
      <li>Coal, petroleum, and natural gas.</li>
      <li>Limestone (CaCO<sub>3</sub>).</li>
      <li>Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (~0.04%).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Uses of Carbon:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Energy Source: Coal, oil, and natural gas are carbon-based fuels.</li>
  <li>Steel Production: Used in the form of coke to extract iron from ores.</li>
  <li>Electrodes: Graphite is used in batteries and as electrodes in electrolysis.</li>
  <li>Lubricants: Graphite is used as a dry lubricant in machinery.</li>
  <li>Materials: Diamond is used in cutting tools, while carbon fibers are used in high-strength materials.</li>
  <li>Medicine: Carbon isotopes (e.g., carbon-14) are used in radiocarbon dating and medical diagnostics.</li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Backbone of Life: Forms the basis of organic chemistry; present in all living organisms.</li>
  <li>Energy Storage: Carbohydrates and fats are carbon-based molecules used for energy.</li>
  <li>Role in Photosynthesis: Plants convert CO<sub>2</sub> to glucose using sunlight.</li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Allotropic Forms: Exists in multiple allotropes (diamond, graphite, fullerenes, graphene, etc.) with distinct properties.</li>
  <li>High Bonding Ability: Can form long chains and complex structures with itself and other elements.</li>
  <li>Role in Climate: Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas affecting Earth's climate.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Carbon:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Ancient Knowledge:
    <ul>
      <li>Carbon in the form of charcoal has been used since ancient times.</li>
      <li>Graphite was known and used in early writing instruments (pencils).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Modern Studies: The discovery of fullerenes in 1985 expanded the understanding of carbon allotropes.</li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Carbon Allotropes:
    <ul>
      <li>Diamond is the hardest natural substance.</li>
      <li>Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms, is one of the strongest and most conductive materials.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Carbon Cycle: Essential for life, carbon continuously cycles through the atmosphere, oceans, and living organisms.</li>
  <li>Isotopes: Carbon-12 and Carbon-13 are stable, while Carbon-14 is radioactive and used in dating ancient materials.</li>
</ol>
