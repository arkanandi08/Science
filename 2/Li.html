  </ol>
  <b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Abundance in Earth's Crust: ~20 ppm (parts per million) </li>
    <li>Found in mineral sources such as:
      Spodumene (LiAlSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) </li>
  </ol>
  <b>Uses of Lithium:-</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Batteries:
      Widely used in lithium-ion batteries for mobile phones, laptops, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage.</li>
    <li>Alloys:
      Used to make lightweight, strong alloys for the aerospace industry.</li>
    <li>Pharmaceuticals:

    <li>Glass and Ceramics:
      Improves the strength and thermal resistance of glass and ceramics.</li>
    <li>Nuclear Applications:
      Lithium-6 isotope is used as a coolant and for tritium production in nuclear reactions.</li>
  </ol>
  <b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Lightweight: Lithium is the lightest solid element.</li>
    <li>Energy Storage: Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized portable energy storage.</li>
    <li>Flame Test: Emits a bright crimson-red flame when burned.</li>
  </ol>
  <b>Discovery:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>1817: <ul>
        <li>Johan August Arfvedson, a Swedish chemist, discovered lithium while analyzing the mineral petalite (LiAlSi<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>).</li>
        <li>Arfvedson found a new element in the mineral but could not isolate it in its pure form.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Name Origin:
      Lithium gets its name from the Greek word “lithos” meaning “stone,” reflecting its discovery in a mineral rather than in biological or aquatic sources like other alkali metals.</li>
    <li>Early Applications: <ul>
        <li>In the 19th century, lithium salts were used as a treatment for gout and later for various mental health conditions.</li>
        <li>The first widespread industrial use of lithium occurred in lithium-based lubricants during the early 20th century, thanks to its ability to withstand high temperatures.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Lithium was first isolated in 1817 by Johan August Arfvedson.</li>
    <li>The name “Lithium” is derived from the Greek word *lithos*, meaning “stone.”</li>
    <li>It’s one of the only elements produced during the Big Bang.</li>
