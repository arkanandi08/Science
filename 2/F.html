<b>Chemical Properties:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Reactivity:
    <ul>
      <li>Highly reactive and the most electronegative element.</li>
      <li>Forms compounds with nearly all elements, including noble gases like xenon.</li>
      <li>Reacts with hydrogen to form hydrogen fluoride (HF), a highly corrosive compound.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Oxidizing Agent:
    <ul>
      <li>Fluorine is a powerful oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing substances that other elements cannot.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Abundance in Earth's Crust: ~0.054% by mass.</li>
  <li>Found in:
    <ul>
      <li>Fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>), a major source of fluorine.</li>
      <li>Cryolite (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>), used in aluminum production.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Uses of Fluorine:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Industrial Uses:
    <ul>
      <li>In the production of fluorocarbons and Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE).</li>
      <li>Used in manufacturing uranium hexafluoride (UF<sub>6</sub>) for nuclear fuel processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dental Health:
    <ul>
      <li>Fluoride compounds, such as sodium fluoride (NaF), are added to toothpaste and water supplies to prevent tooth decay.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Etching Glass: Used in hydrofluoric acid for etching glass and metals.</li>
  <li>Refrigerants: Fluorine-based compounds are widely used in refrigeration systems (e.g., freons).</li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Beneficial in Trace Amounts:
    <ul>
      <li>Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and helps prevent cavities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>High Toxicity:
    <ul>
      <li>Excessive fluoride exposure can cause fluorosis, leading to tooth and bone damage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Most Electronegative: Fluorine has the highest electronegativity of all elements (3.98 on the Pauling scale).</li>
  <li>Highly Reactive: Can form compounds even with noble gases like xenon and krypton.</li>
  <li>Hydrofluoric Acid: One of the few acids that can dissolve glass.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Fluorine:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    <ul>
      <li>Isolated in 1886 by French chemist Henri Moissan through the electrolysis of potassium bifluoride (KHF<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen fluoride (HF).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Historical Use:
    <ul>
      <li>Fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>) was used in metallurgy since ancient times as a flux.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Symbol Origin: "F" comes from the Latin word *fluere*, meaning "to flow," referring to its use as a flux in metalworking.</li>
  <li>Reactive Nature: Fluorine is so reactive it can ignite organic materials on contact.</li>
  <li>Unique Compounds: Teflon, a fluorine-containing polymer, is highly non-stick and resistant to chemical attack.</li>
</ol>
