</ul>

<b>Chemical Properties:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Reactivity: 
    <ul>
      <li>Low reactivity compared to other group 2 elements.</li>
      <li>Resists oxidation when exposed to air due to the formation of a thin oxide layer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amphoteric Behavior: 
    Beryllium oxide (BeO) exhibits amphoteric properties, reacting with both acids and bases.
  </li>
  <li>Flame Test: Emits a pale white or grayish light.</li>
</ol>

<b>Occurrence and Abundance:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Abundance in Earth's Crust: ~0.0002% (relatively rare).</li>
  <li>Commonly found in minerals, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Beryl (Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>) – a gemstone (emerald, aquamarine).</li>
      <li>Beryllium oxide (BeO).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Uses of Beryllium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Aerospace: Used in aircraft, satellites, and spacecraft due to its light weight and high thermal stability.</li>
  <li>Electronics: Essential in producing high-performance electrical components.</li>
  <li>Nuclear Reactors: Acts as a reflector and moderator for neutrons.</li>
  <li>Alloys: Used in beryllium-copper alloys to increase strength, durability, and electrical conductivity.</li>
  <li>X-ray Equipment: Utilized in X-ray windows due to its transparency to X-rays.</li>
</ol>

<b>Biological Role:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Non-Essential Element: Beryllium has no known biological role and can be toxic in significant amounts.</li>
  <li>Toxicity: Exposure to beryllium dust or fumes can cause chronic beryllium disease (CBD), a serious lung condition.</li>
</ol>

<b>Unique Characteristics:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Lightweight: One of the lightest structural metals with high stiffness-to-weight ratio.</li>
  <li>Thermal Properties: Excellent heat conductor with a high melting point.</li>
  <li>Non-Magnetic: Ideal for applications requiring non-magnetic properties.</li>
</ol>

<b>History of Beryllium:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Discovery:
    In 1798, French chemist Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin discovered beryllium as an oxide in the mineral beryl.
  </li>
  <li>Isolation: 
    In 1828, Friedrich Wöhler and Antoine Bussy independently isolated beryllium metal through the reduction of beryllium chloride with potassium.
  </li>
  <li>Modern Use: 
    Beryllium became widely used in the 20th century, especially in the aerospace and electronics industries.
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Interesting Facts:-</b>
<ol>
  <li>Origin of the Name: Derived from "beryllos," the Greek word for the mineral beryl.</li>
  <li>Transparency to X-rays: Beryllium is nearly transparent to X-rays, making it critical in medical and industrial imaging applications.</li>
  <li>Gemstone Connection: The gemstone emerald is a variety of beryl containing chromium or vanadium impurities.</li>
</ol>
