</ol>


<b>History:-</b> <ol>
<li>Discovery: Helium was discovered by Jules Janssen and Norman Lockyer in 1868.</li> 
<li>Name: The name "Helium" comes from the Greek word "helios," meaning sun.</li>
<li>First Isolation: Helium was first isolated by William Ramsay in 1895.</li>
</ol>


<b>Interesting Facts:-</b> <ol>
<li>Only Element That Cannot Be Solidified: <ul>
<li>Helium is the only element that cannot be solidified at normal pressure.</li> <li>It requires a pressure of at least 25 atm to solidify at a temperature of 1.76 K (-271.39°C or -456.5°F).</li>
</ul> </li>
<li>Superfluidity: Helium-4 becomes a superfluid at temperatures below 2.17 K (-270.98°C or -455.76°F), exhibiting unusual properties such as zero viscosity.</li>
<li>Helium Shortage: The world's helium supply is dwindling, and conservation efforts are underway to reduce waste and increase recycling.</li>
